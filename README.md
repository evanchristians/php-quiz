## What I've learnt
This project taught the skills to setup and call elements in a _basic database_ 
using **PHP** functions and arrays.
I've learnt how to use **PHP** within **HTML** elements and **JavaScript** methods. I've learnt how to use _for loops_ to compile **HTML** and manipulate frontend elements.
I used _switch statements_ and _random functions_ to build a stimulating and interactive
user experience.
