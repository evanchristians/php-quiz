## Learning
```
This project taught the skills to setup and call elements in a basic database 
using PHP functions and arrays.

I learnt how to use PHP within HTML elements and JavaScript methods and how to use 
for loops to write HTML and manipulate frontend elements.

I used switch statements and random functions to build a stimulating and interactive
user experience.

I would like to improve my code's efficiency in the future.
